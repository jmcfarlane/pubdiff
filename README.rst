Pubdiff
=======

Easy, anonymous, and public code diffs.

Installation
++++++++++++

The pubdiff client is written in Python, so::

 # Preferred
 sudo pip install pubdiff

 # Also fine
 sudo easy_install pubdiff

Usage
+++++

The idea behind pubdiff, is to use your version control system to
generate a diff, and "send" it to pubdiff.  Let's give that a go::

 cd some/project
 vim some/file
 git add some/file
 git diff --cached | pubdiff

You'll then get a url you can use and share :)

Problems
++++++++

Pubdiff is **very** young, in fact it's only had about 10 days of
development so far.  You'll probably find lots of situations where the
tool either breaks, or renders diffs that look like garbage.  Give it
time :)
